Description             : HACX is an action filled DOOM Engine game.
                          The story is set in the near future, where you'll
                          find yourself engrossed in an international
                          blastfest. Wield weapons of mass destruction
                          from China to Paris to combat a devilish
                          artificial intelligence and its hordes of
                          loyal fanatics. Can you handle it, hacker?
                          
                          This release is a stand-alone IWAD that does not
                          require DOOM II to run, and is compatible with
                          many popular ports. Release also includes several
                          minor map fixes since v1.1 (making levels fully
                          co-op compatible) and other miscellaneous tweaks.

                          HACX.WAD can be run either as an IWAD with ZDoom
                          and Eternity or as a PWAD alongside DOOM II using
                          other ports like Chocolate Doom and PRBoom.
